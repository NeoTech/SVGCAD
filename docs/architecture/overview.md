# Architecture Overview

The CAD Editor is built with a modular architecture that emphasizes separation of concerns and maintainability. This document provides a high-level overview of the system architecture and design principles.

## Architectural Layers

### 1. UI Layer
- **User Interface**: Handles user interactions and visual presentation
- **Drawing Tools**: Implements specific drawing operations
- **Properties Panel**: Manages object property editing

### 2. Core Layer
- **App State Manager**: Central coordinator for application state
- **Canvas Manager**: Handles rendering and model management
- **Constraint Manager**: Manages geometric constraints

### 3. Model Layer
- **Geometric Models**: Represents geometric primitives
- **Constraints**: Defines relationships between models

### 4. Utility Layer
- **Math Utils**: Provides geometric calculations
- **Logger**: Handles debugging and error reporting
- **Storage Utils**: Manages file operations

## Design Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns
Each component has a specific responsibility:
- UI components handle only user interaction
- Managers coordinate between components
- Models focus on data representation
- Utils provide shared functionality

### 2. Event-Driven Architecture
- Components communicate through events
- State changes trigger updates
- Loose coupling between components

### 3. Command Pattern
- All operations are encapsulated as commands
- Enables undo/redo functionality
- Maintains consistent state

### 4. Observer Pattern
- Models notify observers of changes
- UI updates automatically
- Maintains consistency

## Key Components

### App State Manager
- Central coordinator
- Manages application state
- Handles undo/redo
- Coordinates tools

### Canvas Manager
- Renders graphics
- Manages model instances
- Handles selection
- Coordinates with SVG

### Constraint Manager
- Validates geometric constraints
- Solves constraint systems
- Updates model positions

### Models
- Represent geometric entities
- Implement rendering logic
- Handle property management

## Dependencies

The application relies on the following key technologies:
- SVG for rendering
- Alpine.js for reactive UI
- Custom math utilities
- Modern JavaScript (ES6+)

## Performance Considerations

1. **Rendering Optimization**
   - Efficient SVG manipulation
   - Batch updates
   - Request animation frame

2. **State Management**
   - Immutable state updates
   - Efficient undo/redo
   - Selective rerendering

3. **Constraint Solving**
   - Optimized solver
   - Cached calculations
   - Progressive updates

## Security Considerations

1. **Input Validation**
   - Sanitize all user input
   - Validate file imports
   - Check constraint validity

2. **File Operations**
   - Safe file handling
   - Proper error handling
   - Secure storage

## Future Considerations

1. **Extensibility**
   - Plugin architecture
   - Custom tool support
   - Additional constraints

2. **Performance**
   - WebGL rendering
   - Worker threads
   - Improved algorithms

3. **Features**
   - 3D support
   - Cloud storage
   - Collaboration
